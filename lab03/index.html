            <p>Lab02: This assignment wasn't too difficult, I was only hung up by one thing. 
                When I tried this assignment before class I didn't know where to put the article tag. 
                I tried using the developer.modzilla.org site to help me but I couldn't get it. 
                Now that we have gone over it in class I understand where it goes but I'm still a little confused about this purpose.

                Lab03: This assignment was pretty straightfoward and it was fun getting to play around with the colors and fonts.
                I learned that it is quite difficult to find colors that actually go together.
                One thing I need to work on is my organization of the code.
