        <p>EmotionML is a special type of computer language developed by W3C to help computers understand and interpret human feelings. It's basically like a emotional translator for humans and machines. Do we really want this though? This is where things start to get scary.</p>
        
        <p>The language was finally created after years of research starting in 2006. Scientists wanted to make sure it would be useful in day to day life while being accurate. The final 1.0 version was published after a lot testing and feedback.</p>
        
        <div class="list">
            <p>EmotionML has four main ways to describe emotions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Categories (ex. like "happy" or "angry")</li>
                <li>Dimensions (ex. measuring feelings on scales)</li>
                <li>Appraisals (ex. why we feel a certain way)</li>
                <li>Action tendencies (ex. what do we want to do when we feel a certain way)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>One thing I found interesting and unique was that EmotionML doesn't force one way to describe emotions. Instead, it uses different systems that work together.</p>
