                        Lab02: This assignment wasn't too difficult, I was only hung up by one thing. 
                        When I tried this assignment before class I didn't know where to put the article tag. 
                        I tried using the developer.modzilla.org site to help me but I couldn't get it. 
                        Now that we have gone over it in class I understand where it goes but I'm still 
                        a little confused about this purpose.

                        Lab03: This assignment was pretty straightfoward and it was fun getting to play
                        around with the colors and fonts. I learned that it is quite difficult to find 
                        colors that actually go together. One thing I need to work on is my organization of the code.

                        Lab05: This Lab was by far the hardest one in this class and I dont even know if I did everyhting correct.
                        I was very confused at first but after going back and looking at class recordings and also using w3 schools, I finished
                        but there are still things that I wanted to chnage but couldn't figure out like this how this text is being formatted.
                        I am also getting a css error when I validate it but I dotn underastand what the problem is becuase I have the same exact
                        thing right below it and im not gettign any errors.
