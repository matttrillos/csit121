                        Lab02: This assignment wasn't too difficult, I was only hung up by one thing. 
                        When I tried this assignment before class I didn't know where to put the article tag. 
                        I tried using the developer.modzilla.org site to help me but I couldn't get it. 
                        Now that we have gone over it in class I understand where it goes but I'm still 
                        a little confused about this purpose.

                        Lab03: This assignment was pretty straightfoward and it was fun getting to play
                        around with the colors and fonts. I learned that it is quite difficult to find 
                        colors that actually go together. One thing I need to work on is my organization of the code.

                        Lab05: Thoughts on Best Design Practices:
                        Some design practices I use are prioritizing organization, importance of color code, and using
                        trial and error in placesd where I can't get it off the start.
